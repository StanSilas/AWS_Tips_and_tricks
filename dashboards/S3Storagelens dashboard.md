Have you ever wondered wish there was a simpler way to keep tabs on the largest S3 buckets in your org without writing a py or a shell script?  
Have you ever wanted something that would keep autoupdating without having to wait for your script to run for 10 hours?  
Say hi to the AWS S3 storage dashboard lens.  

Login to your AWS Console. 
Go to https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1#  
Click on bucket <img width="259" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10617538/195478787-7ddeaa8a-16a0-44c4-b222-b9f5431a1190.png">. 
  
  
Navigate to <img width="1421" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10617538/195478849-de12b2ec-fbb0-4578-8e23-0685f002f2a9.png">. 
Select Create new dashboard.

Choose the options as needed <img width="1421" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10617538/195479049-a592c027-57a6-4ca0-abb2-cdb4b1b16c67.png">. 

Save. 

Wait for a day and check the dashboard. 

You should now be able to see the top 25 buckets with storage and a ton of other metrics.   
Thank you
